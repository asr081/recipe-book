```

- [ ] Take a pan fill up the water, put some pre soaked rice to boil, preferably Basmati. 
- [ ] Rinse the rice, washed the cooked rice with cold water if your rice is overcooked. This will it help stop cooking.
- [ ] While the rice was boiling, you can do other prep work like chopping onions, vegetables, garnishes etc. 
- [ ] Take a wok, or a frying pan. I like iron wok. 
- [ ] Heat up on high heat, add oil (~4 table spoons)
- [ ] When the oil is heated up add Asafoetida*, Cumin seeds, coriander seeds*, mustard seeds*, cloves, cardamom [1 Big black| 4 green ones] and [dried red chilli | green chilli slitted], star anise*, Bay leaves. 
- [ ] within 30 seconds of step 6 add ginger, garlic, onion and saute. This is time when you turn the heat medium
- [ ] As the onion turns pink add your vegetables or separately fried meat along and break the eggs on them. (Or just keep it vegetarian)
- [ ] Add the rest of spices Garam masala, Cumin powder, red chilli powder. Saute along ! 
- [ ] Cover to cook your veggies , but not too much. 
- [ ] Add the rice which you cooked , mix it lightly avoid breaking rice while mixing. 
- [ ] Fried rice are ready, serve it hot with garnishing. 
- [ ] Serve with any curry, chutney, or natural yoghurt. 
- [ ] Feel free to send improvisations.
